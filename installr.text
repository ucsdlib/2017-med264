## R

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language that is
especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical
analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

#### Windows {#r-windows}

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe
file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the
[RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Mac OS X {#r-macosx}

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg
file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the
[RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).


#### Linux {#r-linux}

You can download the binary files for your distribution from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your
package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run
`sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`).
Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).


##Install rentrez

`rentrez` is on CRAN, so you can get the latest stable release with `install.packages("rentrez")`. The GitHub repository <https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez> will sometimes be a little ahead of the CRAN version, if you want the latest (and possibly greatest) version you can install the current github version using Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools). There might be issues with installing rentrez because of underlying dependencies. It installed easily in Mac OS.

library(devtools)  
install_github("ropensci/rentrez")
